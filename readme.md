## Overview

Equation Quest is an educational math game where players guide a glowing ball by creating mathematical paths to collect stars. By experimenting with different equations, players can create various curves and trajectories, making math interactive and visual.

## Features

- **Interactive Equation System**: Type custom mathematical equations to create paths
- **Neon Visuals**: Retro-futuristic aesthetic with glowing effects
- **Multiple Math Functions**: Use sine, cosine, tangent, and more in your equations
- **Challenge Mode**: Collect all stars to complete each level

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls

- **E**: Edit the current equation
- **R**: Reset level
- **H**: View help screen
- **ESC**: Quit game
- **Enter**: Confirm equation (when editing)

## How to Play

1. Use mathematical equations to create paths for the ball to follow
2. Collect all stars to complete the level
3. Experiment with different equations to see how they affect the path

## Example Equations

- Simple line: `0.5*x + 100`
- Parabola: `0.001*x^2 + 200`
- Sine wave: `100*sin(0.01*x) + 300`
- Complex curve: `0.0005*x^2 + 50*sin(0.02*x) + 250`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NumPy

## Development

Equation Quest is built with:
- Pygame for rendering and game loop
- NumPy for mathematical operations
- Safe expression evaluation for user-input equations
